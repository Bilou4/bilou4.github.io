# Natural Referencing

## The domain name

- avoid `-` which are considered as penalizing

- it's better without offensive words and easy to spell

- the size of the domain name must be about 9 words

- register your domain name for 1 year or less is characterized as suspicious

- a valid SSL certificate is better

  

## Page construction

- you need keywords related to your site
- the content of the pages must be relevant and organized
- if the speed of loading the page is long ( Ex: images too heavy) your site will be less well referenced
- it is preferable to have a qualitative code
